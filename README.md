# Rui Wu's Portfolio

I am currently studying User Experience Design at UW. I feel very passionate about utilizing my creativity to help users quickly solve problems. In the future, I want to become a UX designer and focus on design and implementation. The first step for me to achieve my goal is to build my personal portfolio site to show my design work. I am excited to apply the things I learned from class to code my own portfolio site.
