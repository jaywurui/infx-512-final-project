                    <p style="font-size:1.2rem; margin-top:2rem; margin-bottom:2rem; line-height: 1.7em">Easy Parkin’ is a prototypal mobile application that provides an easy and free solution for people to
                        find an available parking spot. “Find a spot” and “Pin a spot” are two major features of this mobile
                        app. Users are able to find available parking spots to park their cars by using the “Find a spot”
                        feature, and they can also report an empty spot via the “Pin a spot” feature to help others. There
                        is also a customer rewards system built in the app to motivate users to actively use the app and
                        help the business grow.</p>

                    <h3 style="color:red; margin-top:2rem; text-align:center">Problem</h3>
                    <p style="font-size:1.2rem; margin-top:2rem; line-height: 1.7em">I got my first car in college, and it was a life-changing event for me. I experienced the wonderful convenience
                        that I had never experienced before; however, at the same time, finding a parking spot to park my
                        car before my class starts was very stressful. I believed that many people face the same problem
                        with parking and feel the same pain, and I was motivated to come up with a solution to make people’s
                        life easier.

                    <p style="font-size:1.2rem; margin-top:2rem; line-height: 1.7em">I teamed up with two designers who were interested in my ideas and started our research on the topic.
                        We conducted both primary research and secondary research to get a better understanding of user needs
                        and explore the design requirements for final solution. </p>

                    <h5>Survey & Interview</h5>
                    <p style="font-size:1.2rem; margin-top:2rem; margin-bottom:2rem; line-height: 1.7em">For the primary research, we surveyed 48 participants and interviewed 5 interviewees to gather both quantitative
                        data and qualitative information to better understand users’ profiles, behaviors, needs, and challenges
                        around parking. We found that:
                        <ul>
                            <li>88% of the survey participants struggle with parking often. 92% of them are college students
                                who feel stressful to park on campus even with parking permits. 8% of them are young professionals
                                who feel stressful to park in the downtown area.</li>
                            <li>The survey participants and interviewees who struggle with parking often spend long time driving
                                around the parking lot to look for an available parking spot.</li>
                            <li>The survey participants and interviewees want to be able to better locate specific available
                                parking spots and stop wasting time and gas driving around the parking lot.</li>
                    </p>
